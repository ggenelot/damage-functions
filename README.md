# Damage functions


Repo to store my literature review on damage functions. It aims at providing an overview of the different damage functions that exist in Integrated Assessment Models. 

It should contain 3 files : 

- a CSV file containing the comparison
- a bib file containing all the references
- a plain text or markdown file containing the bibliography in plain text, and maybe an analysis
